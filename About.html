<p> Christ the King School of Muntinlupa (CKSM) was conceived during the last quarter of 1993.  Its founder, Dr. Jose V. Yason, Jr., a physician by profession but profoundly academic at heart, has always dreamed of putting up a school in Muntinlupa.  He finally decided to pursue his dreams.  Putting all his efforts, time, and resources together, the School was born.

	Dr. Yason sought the services of Mr. Simeon Bumanglag and Mrs. Mercedes V. Caceres to help him go through the different stages of putting up a school.  Mr. Bumanglag has been an outstanding educator who has served numerous academic institutions both in the public and private sectors.  The same can be said of Mrs. Caceres, having been in the profession for decades.

	While the documents required by the Department of Education were being processed, the groundwork for the school building was then laid. CKSM, situated on a 1.5-hectare lot in JAYSONSville II, Putatan, Muntinlupa City, is owned by Jaysons Realty and Development Corporation, a founding member of the Institution.

	In June 1994, CKSM formally opened with only 20 students.  The following SY 1995-1996, CKSMâ€™s population increased by 200% as its enrollment went up to 60.
